# NGSbasedWorkflow
Tool and Workflow used on the paper

This page contains tool and workflow source code to be implemented into [Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://cgc-accounts.sbgenomics.com/auth/login) platform by The Seven Bridges Genomics.

The page contains 2 files:"rapid-identification-workflow.cwl" and "sra-fastq-dump-v2-10-7.cwl".

The first is the main workflow we proposed on the paper that implemented [*centrifuge*](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/manual.shtml) algorithm.
Meanwhile, the second file is the tool we used to fetch sequencing data available on the SRA database.
